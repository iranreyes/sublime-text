### AutoFileName

Whether your making a img tag in html, setting a background image in css, or linking a .js file to your html (or whatever else people use filename paths for these days...), you can now autocomplete the filename. Plus, it uses the built-in autocomplete, so no need to learn another pesky shortcut.
